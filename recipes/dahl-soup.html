       This dish is also rich in micro- and macronutrients like carbohydrates and protein, so it nourishes your body perfectly.
       The ingredients are inexpensive and very simple. Let’s get started!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Canola oil. Feel free to substitute any high-heat oil, such as coconut, avocado, or vegetable oil.</li>
      <li>Onion.</li>
      <li>Garlic.</li>
      <li>Ginger.</li>
      <li>Spices. We're using garam masala, cumin seeds, and turmeric.
	  If you absolutely insist, you can substitute ground cumin for seeds, but I highly recommend using the seeds for the best flavor and a little bit of texture.
	  You can also include a bit of cayenne pepper if you prefer your dal soup on the spicy side.
      </li>
      <li>Split red lentils. Make sure your lentils are split. Whole lentils will take longer to cook and will have a different texture.</li>
      <li>Vegetable broth. I used Better Than Bouillon in seasoned vegetable flavor.</li>
      <li>Coconut milk. Make sure you're using canned coconut milk (not coconut milk beverage, sold in cartons).
	  I recommend going with full-fat, but you can use light if you're trying to cut back on calories and/or fat.
      </li>
      <li>Canned diced tomatoes.</li>
      <li>Lemon juice. Use freshly squeezed juice for the best flavor.</li>
      <li>Fresh cilantro. Feel free to leave this out or substitute scallions if you're not a fan of cilantro.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat up your oil in a large pot, then add diced onion.
	  Sweat the onion for a few minutes, until it starts to soften up, then stir in the garlic, ginger, and spices.
	  Cook everything together very briefly, just until it becomes fragrant.
	  Be careful: cooking this mixture too long can burn your spices and aromoatics, which can make your soup taste bitter.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in your broth and red lentils. Bring the soup up to a simmer and let it cook for about 20 minutes, until the lentils are very soft.</li>
      <li>Stir in the coconut milk and tomatoes. Let the soup continue simmering for about 5 minutes more.
	  By now the lentils should be mostly broken down, giving your soup a thick, almost creamy texture.
      </li>
      <li>Take the pot off of the burner and stir in some fresh lemon juice, along with salt and pepper to taste.
	  Serve your Indian lentil soup with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro.
      </li>
    </ol>

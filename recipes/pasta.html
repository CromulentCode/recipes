    <h1>Pasta all'Amatriciana</h1>
    <img src=../images/pasta-all'Amatriciana.jpg>
    <p>This classic sauce takes its spiciness from black pepper and dried chiles and its depth of flavor from guanciale,
       Italian salt-cured pork jowl. If you can't find it, use pancetta, which is available at better supermarkets.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>4 oz. thinly sliced guanciale, pancetta, or chopped unsmoked bacon </li>
      <li>½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes </li>
      <li>½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper </li>
      <li>¾ cup minced onion </li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
      <li>1 28-oz. can peeled tomatoes with juices, crushed by hand</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>12 oz. dried bucatini or spaghetti</li>
      <li>¼ cup finely grated Pecorino (about 1 oz.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven or large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add guanciale and sauté until crisp and golden, about 4 minutes.
	  Add pepper flakes and black pepper; stir for 10 seconds. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring often, until soft, about 8 minutes.
	  Add tomatoes, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, 15-20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season with salt; add the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until 2 minutes before al dente.
	  Drain, reserving 1 cup of pasta cooking water.
      </li>
      <li>Add drained pasta to sauce in skillet and toss vigorously with tongs to coat.
	  Add 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water and cook until sauce coats pasta and pasta is al dente, about 2 minutes.
	  (Add a little pasta water if sauce is too dry.) Stir in cheese and transfer pasta to warmed bowls.
